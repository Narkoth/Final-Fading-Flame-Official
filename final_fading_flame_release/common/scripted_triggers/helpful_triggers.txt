### A generic tooltip for when any nation should think about using militia
should_utilize_militia = {
    OR = {
        AND = { # If a nation is involved in a war and has a terrible to half-decent industry
            has_war = yes
            num_of_military_factories < 16
        }
        AND = { # Currently in a war and starting to lose important victory points/territory
            has_war = yes
            surrender_progress > 0.3
        }
        AND = { # While at peace, industry is too terrible to warrant building regular infantry reliably
            has_war = no
            num_of_military_factories < 10
        }
        is_tribal = yes # Tribals will always have a hard time using normal infantry reliably, due to their weaker industrial base
        has_tech = mass_assault # This is, by definition, what doctrine makes sense using militia in
        OR = { # Put specific tags that should use militia anyways here
            tag = R01
        }
    }
}

### War in Caer has ended
caer_civil_war_ended_trigger = {
    custom_trigger_tooltip = {
		tooltip = caer_civil_war_ended_tooltip
		OR = {
            NOT = {country_exists = CAE}
            NOT = {country_exists = FAE}
        }
	}
}

### War in Caer is Ongoing
caer_civil_war_ongoing_trigger = {
    custom_trigger_tooltip = {

### Since is_major is not helpful in our mod, created a new one that should prove to be useful
### This is also helpful in establishing nations that have decent industrial base to get things working and running

is_strong = { 
    OR = {
        num_of_factories > 40
        tag = DOC
        tag = ROC
        tag = COC
        tag = CIS
    }
}

### Useful trigger for checking nations if they have a large amount of naval dockyards, which can be very helpful for ai strategies
### Also helpful for some nations, that we WANT to be considered navally powerful that don't have many dockyards, like DOC which starts with a large navy
### This is also EXTREMELY helpful in ai_will_do for technology as well, since we are going to have so many nations, writing GOOD generic code will help us SO MUCH in the long run

has_large_naval_capability = {
    OR = {
        num_of_naval_factories > 20
        tag = DOC
    }
}

### Political Triggers that put ideologies in their "group" categories, making for much easier checking
### Instead of having to check for a whole bunch of ideologies, simply do something like:
### available = {
###     is_tribal = no
### }

        has_government = full_theocracy
