DOC_decentralize:0 "Prior to our retreat from the mainland, Caer was an autonomous region within the Kingdom. We annexed it to properly fortify it against potential Ronard invasion, but this has come to pass. By giving them back some autonomy, we can further increase the stability of the realm, and the people's trust in our government."

ROC_indie_army:0 "The problem with mercs, is that they can be very unreliable, as they are only tied to us via their paycheck. Instead, we should create a traditional army, coming from the people in our control."
ROC_merc_army:0 "We are a company that has superceded and become the state. Instead of conscripting the people we control, we should use our mass wealth to only hire the very best soldiers from the world. People may not like the idea of an entirely merc army, but they will adjust in time ... as they wouldn't have much of a choice."
