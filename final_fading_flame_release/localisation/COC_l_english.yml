coc_aid_fae_desc:0 "A civil war is waging in the territory of Caer. The war is between the Free Caer Commune, and the Kingdom of Caer.\n\nSeveral years back the corrupt Caer government was overthrown by the Commune, but direct intervention from the Dominion of Castor resulted in the Commune being beaten back to the Western Marshes, while the Kingdom of Caer was founded and installed by the Dominion. Now, the Commune has launched a full-scale offensive to take back their country from the hands of the Dominion.\n\nIf we are to call ourselves true Communalists, then we must look towards aiding our brothers and sisters in their conflicts. If we invest some time and energy into purchasing foreign weapons and equipment, we can send them to the Commune to hopefully turn the tide more into their favor."
